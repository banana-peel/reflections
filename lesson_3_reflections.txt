When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are multiple people working on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You don't want unwanted changes to suddenly get added to your repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is cloning on the github repository. Clones are making a copy of the repository from either github to local
or on the local itself. Branches is an additional branch on the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Helps in branching. If some collaborator has made any changes and you want to add changes to that then you can merge
