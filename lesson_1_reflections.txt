Finding changes in code is really difficult for big files
Diff old new was a great way to see how everything changes on changing code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Currently I'm having problems where I've at least 20 different codes and don't know which one to use. Having version
control will be very helpful

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Automatic commits will save codes which don't make any sense, it's better to save manually and ensure that each
save/commit means something

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
For coding many files may be related. In such a scenario we need to update all the files at the same time. Changing
one by one will be a really big hassle

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log can be used to see the description of how the files have changed and to find the particular commit that we
want. git diff can then be used to find the changes between the commit from the previous commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Version control makes it really easy to find mistakes. I can be more sure that the damage won't be 
irepairable

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
All the projects I've been working on. Seriously this seems awesome!
