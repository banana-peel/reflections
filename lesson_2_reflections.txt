What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
So I can use git with it. I see that the promt in my terminal also change to show master before
the folder name

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Kind of gives an intermediate area between actually commiting and the work folder. Also makes it possible to commit
more than 1 file at a time
